                The magnificent Bird house in El nido, Palawan. However before you can see this wonderful site you will need stamina and alot of patience to get here, trust me. To get here you need approximately 70 steps down from the road, walk around 600 meters across the Maremegmeg Beach, walk another 150 meters going inside a forest. and climb up 200 steps to reach the top. But it doesnt mean going through this hectic journy will give you nothing, as you pass those sites you will get to experience the marvel the sights of nature will give. </p>

"There was a poor traveller travelling with his six poor friends. After there Satisfying lunch at one of the beaches in palawan they were feeling exhausted. As they fell asleep by the waves slapping throught their boat. as they woke up one of the travellers saw the secret beach and the others taught he was joking because it is really hidden.". The Wall-like gray karst cliffs surrounding me went ignored as I stood in the middle of a pocket of white beach on one edge of Matinloc Island. I was at the so called “Secret Beach,”.

                <p class="drop-cap">Do not miss it; book a private tour and do whatever you can to reach it before the mob arrives; this beach is somewhat off the path of the organized tours and therefore you will bump into much smaller crowds but yet there is something magic to be the first to paddle into the lagoon and walk on the white sand, still a little cold and damp from the night!

                <br>
                <p class="drop-cap">One of the attractions of the island hopping tour is relatively small compared to other attractions. It is a very well-equipped small island. It is not much different from other islands. The water is clear and white and the coconut groves are lush. Snorkeling here is also Very suitable.</p>

                The seven commando name comes from the coconut trees standing with pride and tall like they are ready for battle. At the same time, as our boat inched closer to the shore, their leaves waved like mothers eagerly awaiting the return of their long lost children. We, the lost children, jumped off of our boats and embraced the wide bed of white sand, which gently gets steeper as you move farther inland. That’s what makes 7 Commandos Beach an ideal place for a romance with the sun. It has a vast sandy shore that is perfect for sunbathing or playing sports or simply lazing.

                <p class="drop-cap">Spectacular views, beautiful rocky & green surroundings! Very picturesque. It’s bit more challenging canopy walk then those I’ve done in past. Make sure you have good walking/ hiking shoes as you’ll need them especially for the first, which is also last steep part. Don’t wear flip flops like I did.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="drop-cap">We met up with our tour guide at 6am and started walking to the jump off point. From there, our ascent was gradual but immediately required some rock climbing/scrambling skills. The terrain was rocky and steep with sharp limestone rocks that needed proper climbing shoes or at least trainers to protect your feet. Gloves would also be useful to aid climbers in the hazardous journey.

The beautiful landscape, the palm trees scattering on the beach, with the sandy dirt roads all in here is really woth the ride. Nacpan is one of the beaches with most stretched sand in palawan with 4 kilometer soft creamed color sand and coconuts as you look up. The ocean breeze will trully be mesmerize by the people.</p>

                <p class="drop-cap">Nacpan Beach is a must see if you are in El Nido. The beach is large with many shops, drink stands and places to eat. As with all must see tourist sites it can get very crowed. Still worth it for a day trip.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="drop-cap">We were practically alone in Nacpan Beach! It was a really big beach and we used the ATV and hung out at Angkla Beach Resort.</p>

                The Small Lagoon is a bit hidden. Unlike the Big Lagoon next door, which has a big open channel, the Small Lagoon can only be entered through a tiny crack in the limestone rock wall. It’s only possible to swim inside or enter with a kayak (make sure to duck your head it really is a tight entrance). This makes the Small Lagoon pretty special and it has a uique atmosphere inside the narrow lagoon.</p>

                <p class="drop-cap">Small lagoon was beautiful and well preserved. It was a nice and chill kayaking experience. We also took a nice swim within the lagoon
</p>
                <br>
                <p class="drop-cap">At first you'd get a bit scared kayaking in such a quiet lagoon but when you reach the inner part, you'll see a very lovely sight. Its very beautiful</p>

                Not only it is a beautiful sight on the land it is also beautiful up above the sky. The big lagoon is really truly magnificent sight to see in El Nido.A narrow and shallow entrance channel leads you out into a giant lagoon surrounded by epic limestone cliffs. It has it all From Kayaking to Snorkling. The big lagoon offers you many fun oppurtunities for you and for your family.

                <p class="drop-cap">Although I rarely take tours this one was a lot of fun. Exploring the coast. Eating a great meal provided by the crew and swimming in the various locations was a great experience. Once inside the lagoon and being surrounded by the high cliffs it is an amazing experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="drop-cap">We kayaked around the lagoon and it waz great as very few visitors. So we were truly privileged to be able to soaked in the scenery in a rather quiet environment! </p>
